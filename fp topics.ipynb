      "Health risks of warming of 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and higher, above pre-industrial temperatures\n",
      "climate change; dengue; occupational health; malaria; temperature-related mortality; undernutrition; ozone\n",
      "Background: In response to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the research community was asked to estimate differences in sectoral-specific risks at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C increases in global mean surface air temperature (SAT) above pre-industrial temperatures. Projections of the health risks of climate change typically focus on time periods and not on the magnitude of temperature change. Objective: Summarize projections of health risks associated with temperature extremes and occupational heat stress, air quality, undernutrition, and vector-borne diseases to estimate how these risks would differ at increases in warming of 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and higher. Methods: A comprehensive search strategy included English language publications since 2008 projecting health risks of climate change identified through established databases. Of 109 relevant publications, nearly all were for future time periods (e.g. in 2030 and 2050) rather than future SAT thresholds. Time periods were therefore converted to temperature changes based on the models and scenarios used. Results: Warming of 1.5 degrees C is reached in about the 2030s for all multi-model means under all scenarios and warming of 2 degrees C is reached in about the 2050s under most scenarios. Of the 40 studies projecting risks at 1.5 and 2 degrees C increases of SAT, risks were higher at 2 degrees C for adverse health consequences associated with exposures to high ambient temperatures, ground-level ozone, and undernutrition, with regional variations. Risks for vector-borne diseases could increase or decrease with higher global mean temperatures, depending on regional climate responses and disease ecology. Conclusions: The burden of many climate-sensitive health risks are projected to be greater at an increase of 2 degrees C SAT above pre-industrial temperatures than at 1.5 degrees C. Future projection studies should report results based on changes in global and regional mean SATs and time, to facilitate quantitative analyses of health risks and to inform the level of ambition and timing of adaptation interventions.\n",

      "Short-term (24 h) experiments were performed to examine the effect of anthracene (ANT) on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cw92 grown in a batch culture system aerated with 2.5% CO2 At concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 5.6 mu M, ANT inhibited the growth of population in a concentration-dependent manner and EC50 calculated amounted to 1.6 mu M. At concentrations from 0.7 to 4.2 mu M ANT stimulated respiration and inhibited the intensity of photosynthesis but did not affect chlorophyll content in the cells. ANT influenced chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, measured by OJIP test (O, J, I and P are the different steps of fluorescence induction curve). ANT diminished the performance index (PI), the yield of primary photochemistry (phi(Po)), the yield of electron transport (phi(Eo,) the efficiency of moving the electron beyond Qa(-) (Psi(0)) and the fraction of active oxygen evolving complexes (OEC). The fraction of active PS II reaction centres in the treated samples dramatically dropped. The most pronounced changes in ANT-treated cells were observed in the stimulation of energy dissipation parameter (DI0/RC). The only OJIP parameter that was not influenced by ANT was energy absorption by photosynthetic antennae (ABS). The results lead to a conclusion that the inhibition of photosynthesis may be a consequence of unspecific ANT-membrane interaction, resulting from hydrophobic character of this hydrocarbon.

       "[{'content': \"Recent droughts in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean have emphasized the region's agricultural vulnerability to this hazard and the increasing need for adaptation mechanisms to support sustainable production. In this study, we assessed the geographic extent of agricultural conservation practices incentivized by US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and evaluated their large-scale contribution to drought adaptability. We identified concentrations of drought-related practices (e.g. cover crops, ponds) applied between 2000 and 2016. Using information from spatial databases and interviews with experts, we assessed the spatial correlation between these practices and areas exposed to drought as identified by the US Drought Monitor. Between 2000 and 2016, Puerto Rico experienced seven drought episodes concentrated around the south, east and southeastern regions. The most profound drought occurred between 2014 and 2016 when the island experienced 80 consecutive weeks of moderate drought, 48 of severe drought and 33 of extreme drought conditions. A total of 44 drought-related conservation practices were applied at 6984 locations throughout 860 km(2) of farmlands between 2000 and 2016 through the NRCS-Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Practices related to water availability were statistically clustered along the coasts, whereas soil and plant health practices were clustered in the mountainous region. While these concentrations strongly correlated with areas exposed to moderate drought conditions, >80% did not coincide with areas that experienced severe or extreme drought conditions, suggesting that areas highly exposed to drought conditions generally lacked drought preparedness assisted by EQIP. Climate projections indicate an increase in the frequency and intensity of drought events, particularly in the eastern region of Puerto Rico. Our analysis highlighted the need to implement more conservation practices in these areas subject to drought intensification and exposure. Government programs intended to address vulnerabilities and enhance capacity and resilience may not be reaching areas of highest exposure. Recommendations include raising producer awareness of past and future exposure and making programs more accessible to a broader audience.\",\n",
